**notice:**

Due to work-related reasons, I have decided to close off *agave's* license. It's totally not ideal, but I'm afraid it can't be helped. Please visit the font's new homepage at [baikal.io/agaric/agave][home].

After switching to a closed license, I want to apologise to those who tried out, want to try, or are currently using *agave*. Please do use and share the font in its current state, but if you want updates or direct support, I urge you to visit its new landing at [baikal][home], where my support and updates are available.

## thanks

... foremost to the people behind FontForge and Inkscape, as I relied on the two programs to design, draw, and generate *agave*,

and to GitHub for hosting this repo.
