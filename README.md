## about
*agave* is a fixed-width outline font designed by *[type agaric](http://an.erki.net/~b/type/)*.

The font is free to use and peruse (font files, glyph designs, glyph databases, and documentation released under the [MIT X license](http://an.erki.net/~b/type/agave_license)).

For more details about the font, visit the [designer's page](http://an.erki.net/~b/type/agave).

## status (rev. 008)
* regular:
    * **done:** ascii; latin ext; greek; cyrillic; ipa; arrows; box; *some others*
    * **todo:** more glyphs here and there

* bold:
*yet to be designed*

* italic:
*yet to be designed*

## distribution
* [agave-*REV*-src.tar.gz][1] contains font files, glyphs source, FontForge file, changelog, and license document.
* [agave-*REV*.tar.gz][2] contains just the font files.

**packaging:**

* deb: [ttf-agave][3]
* ebuild: [media-fonts/agave][4]
* pacman: [ttf-agave][5] (AUR)
* rpm spec: [agave-fonts][6]

In each form of distribution, the actual font files are named `agave-?.ttf`,  
where `?` stands for `r`, `b`, `i`, or `z`, representing the *regular*, *bold*, *italic*, and *bold+italic* variants respectively.

**archiving:**

At every revision, the font files are backed up, but source files and documentation are not. Only the latest version of the latter files are uploaded on Bitbucket.

## thanks
... to the people behind FontForge and Inkscape, as I relied on the two programs to design, draw, and generate *agave*,

and to Bitbucket for hosting the files.
